## The Problem

### Current Stablecoin Limitations

**Cross-Chain Fragmentation**
- Traditional stablecoins exist as isolated tokens on individual networks
- Bridge risks introduce counterparty exposure and potential fund loss
- Liquidity fragmentation reduces capital efficiency
- Complex operational overhead across multiple deployments

**Flash Loan Market Gaps**
- Limited network coverage prevents cross-chain arbitrage
- High fees (0.1-0.5%) reduce strategy profitability
- Pool-based models create liquidity constraints
- Non-standard interfaces complicate integration

**User Experience Barriers**
- Gas requirements for every transaction
- Multiple approval transactions increase costs
- Manual network switching and balance management
- Limited cross-chain functionality
