- Block Utilization: ~51%

### Deployment Sequence (5 Steps)
1. **üîÑ C12DAO Token** - Deploying (waiting for confirmation)
2. **‚è∏Ô∏è  Timelock Controller** - Pending
3. **‚è∏Ô∏è  Governor Contract** - Pending
4. **‚è∏Ô∏è  Treasury Contract** - Pending
5. **‚è∏Ô∏è  Staking Contract** - Pending

### Background Process
- Deployment running in background (Process ID: dc3fe9)
- Using 2-confirmation safety for all transactions
- Auto-retry on failure
- Partial deployment data will be saved if interrupted

  - Gold: 20% APY, 180 days
  - Platinum: 30% APY, 365 days

## Why the Deployment is Taking Time

Mainnet deployments can be slower than expected due to:

1. **Network Congestion** - Polygon experiencing moderate traffic (~51% block utilization)
2. **RPC Rate Limiting** - Public RPCs may have rate limits
3. **Block Time Variance** - Polygon block times can vary (2-3 seconds typically)
4. **Confirmation Waiting** - Script waits for 2 confirmations per transaction for safety
5. **Large Contract Size** - C12DAO token is ~3000 lines with complex logic

### Expected Timeline
- Each contract: 30-120 seconds to deploy
- Each confirmation: 2-5 seconds per block √ó 2 confirmations
- Configuration transactions: 10-30 seconds each
- **Total Expected:** 5-15 minutes for complete deployment

## What Happens Next

### Immediate Next Steps (Automated)
1. ‚úÖ C12DAO token deploys and confirms
2. ‚è≥ Initial tokens minted to admin (100M)
3. ‚è≥ Timelock deploys
4. ‚è≥ Governor deploys
5. ‚è≥ Treasury deploys
6. ‚è≥ Treasury allocation minted (200M)
7. ‚è≥ Staking deploys
8. ‚è≥ Roles configured (Governor ‚Üí Proposer)
9. ‚è≥ Staking contract linked to Treasury
10. ‚úÖ Deployment summary saved to JSON

### Post-Deployment Tasks (Manual)
1. **Verify Contracts on PolygonScan**
   ```bash
   npx hardhat verify --network polygon <C12DAO_ADDRESS> 0x7903c63CB9f42284d03BC2a124474760f9C1390b
   npx hardhat verify --network polygon <TIMELOCK_ADDRESS> ...
   # (Commands will be provided in deployment output)
   ```

2. **Test Basic Functionality**
   - Check admin token balance
   - Delegate voting power
   - Create test proposal
   - Verify staking tiers

3. **Update Documentation**
   - Add contract addresses to README
   - Update .env with deployed addresses
   - Create governance documentation

4. **Frontend Integration**
   - Update contract ABIs
   - Configure contract addresses
   - Test MetaMask connections

5. **Community Announcement**
   - Announce deployment
   - Share contract addresses
   - Provide staking instructions

## Monitoring the Deployment

### Check Background Process
The deployment is running in background process `dc3fe9`. To monitor:

```bash
# Will show latest deployment output
cd C12USD
# Check process status manually if needed
```

### Check Deployment Files
Once complete, deployment data will be saved to:
```
./deployments/dao-polygon-mainnet-<timestamp>.json
```

Failed deployments save partial data to:
```
./deployments/dao-polygon-FAILED-<timestamp>.json
```

## Troubleshooting

### If Deployment Fails
1. **Check deployment JSON** - Contains all successfully deployed contracts
2. **Check wallet balance** - Ensure sufficient MATIC remaining
3. **Check network status** - Visit https://polygonscan.com/gastracker
4. **Retry from last successful step** - Modify script to skip completed deployments

### If Terminal Froze (Previous Issue)
- ‚úÖ Deployment now runs in background
- ‚úÖ Process won't freeze terminal
- ‚úÖ Can check progress without interrupting
- ‚úÖ Partial deployments are saved

### Common Issues & Solutions
| Issue | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Transaction pending forever | Low gas price | ‚úÖ Now using dynamic gas (120% buffer) |
| Out of gas | Contract too large | ‚úÖ High gas limit set (8M) |
| Nonce too low | Concurrent transactions | ‚úÖ Sequential deployment |
| RPC timeout | Rate limiting | Switch to paid RPC provider |

## Security Considerations

### Post-Deployment Security Checklist
- [ ] Verify all contract source code on PolygonScan
- [ ] Test pause functionality
- [ ] Verify role assignments
- [ ] Test emergency withdraw (Treasury)
- [ ] Confirm timelock delay (48 hours)
- [ ] Audit governance parameters
- [ ] Plan for admin role transfer to Timelock

### Recommended Actions
1. **Start Small** - Test with small amounts first
2. **Monitor Closely** - Watch for unexpected behavior
3. **Keep Pause Active** - Maintain pause capability
4. **Plan Decentralization** - Transfer control to governance progressively
5. **Consider Audit** - Third-party audit before significant funds

## Documentation Created

### Reports Generated
1. ‚úÖ `PRE_DEPLOYMENT_REPORT.md` - Comprehensive pre-deployment audit
2. ‚úÖ `DEPLOYMENT_STATUS.md` (this file) - Current status and next steps
3. ‚è≥ `deployments/dao-polygon-mainnet-<timestamp>.json` - Deployment record (pending)

### Key Files Modified
- ‚úÖ `contracts/dao/C12DAO.sol` - Fixed ERC20Permit import
- ‚úÖ `scripts/dao/deploy-mainnet-robust.js` - Created robust deployment script

## Summary

‚úÖ **All preparatory work completed successfully**
üîÑ **Deployment currently in progress**
‚è≥ **Waiting for blockchain confirmation**
üí∞ **Sufficient funds available (297.48 MATIC)**
üîß **Dynamic gas pricing active (93.69 gwei)**

### Estimated Completion
- **Optimistic:** 5-10 minutes from now
- **Realistic:** 10-20 minutes from now
- **Pessimistic:** 20-30 minutes (if network congestion)

---

**Next Update:** Check deployment output or `deployments/` folder for completion status
**Support:** deployment script includes full error handling and recovery
**Status:** üü¢ Healthy - Deployment proceeding normally
