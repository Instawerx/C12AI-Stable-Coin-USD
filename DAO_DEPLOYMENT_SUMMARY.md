# C12DAO Deployment Summary
## Ready for Polygon Mainnet Deployment

**Status:** ‚úÖ Day 1 Complete - Ready to Deploy
**Date:** October 1, 2025
**Admin:** 0x7903c63CB9f42284d03BC2a124474760f9C1390b

---

## üéâ What's Been Built

### 5 Smart Contracts (All Compiled ‚úÖ)
1. **C12DAO.sol** - Governance token with vesting
2. **C12DAOGovernor.sol** - DAO governance controller
3. **C12DAOTimelock.sol** - 48-hour timelock
4. **C12DAOTreasury.sol** - Treasury & revenue management
5. **C12DAOStaking.sol** - 5-tier staking system

### Deployment Script
- **scripts/dao/deploy-all.js** - Deploys all contracts + mints tokens to admin

---

## üöÄ Quick Deploy Commands

### Deploy to Polygon Mainnet:
```bash
cd /c/Users/tabor/Downloads/C12USD_project/C12USD

# Deploy all contracts
npx hardhat run scripts/dao/deploy-all.js --network polygon
```

### After Deployment - Verify on PolygonScan:
```bash
# The deploy script will output exact verification commands
# Example:
npx hardhat verify --network polygon <C12DAO_ADDRESS> 0x7903c63CB9f42284d03BC2a124474760f9C1390b
```

## üí∞ What Happens on Deployment

1. **C12DAO Token Deployed**
   - Admin gets: 100M C12DAO (10%)
   - Immediately available in your wallet

2. **Treasury Deployed**
   - Treasury gets: 200M C12DAO (20%)
   - For staking rewards & grants

3. **Governor + Timelock Deployed**
   - Governance system ready
   - 48-hour delay on proposals
   - 7-day voting period

4. **Staking Deployed**
   - 5 tiers ready
   - APY: 10% - 30%
   - Rewards come from Treasury

5. **All Roles Configured**
   - Governor can propose
   - Anyone can execute
   - Admin controls everything initially

---

## üìä Expected Results

**Your Wallet After Deployment:**
- Balance: 100,000,000 C12DAO
- Can delegate voting power immediately
- Can create governance proposals (if 100K threshold met)
- Can stake tokens in any tier

**Treasury Balance:**
- 200,000,000 C12DAO
- Controlled via governance
- Funds staking rewards

**Remaining 700M C12DAO:**
- Still unminted
- Can be minted later for:
  - Community airdrops
  - Liquidity mining
  - Public sale
  - Team vesting
  - Advisors

---

## üîç Verify Everything Works

After deployment, test these functions:

### 1. Check Admin Balance
```bash
npx hardhat console --network polygon
> const C12DAO = await ethers.getContractAt("C12DAO", "<DEPLOYED_ADDRESS>")
> await C12DAO.balanceOf("0x7903c63CB9f42284d03BC2a124474760f9C1390b")
# Should show: 100000000000000000000000000 (100M tokens)
```

### 2. Delegate Voting Power
```bash
> await C12DAO.delegate("0x7903c63CB9f42284d03BC2a124474760f9C1390b")
> await C12DAO.getVotes("0x7903c63CB9f42284d03BC2a124474760f9C1390b")
# Should show: 100000000000000000000000000
```

### 3. Check Treasury Balance
```bash
> await C12DAO.balanceOf("<TREASURY_ADDRESS>")
# Should show: 200000000000000000000000000 (200M tokens)
```

## üí° Next Actions

### Immediate (After Deployment):
1. ‚úÖ Verify all contracts on PolygonScan
2. ‚úÖ Add addresses to `.env` file
3. ‚úÖ Test basic functions (mint, delegate, stake)
4. ‚úÖ Update DAO_PHASE1_TODO_POLYGON.md with addresses

### Short-term (This Week):
1. Create governance proposal templates
2. Set up Snapshot for gasless voting
3. Plan community airdrop strategy
4. Design liquidity mining program
5. Create team vesting schedules

### Medium-term (This Month):
1. Transfer C12USD admin roles to Timelock (decentralization)
2. Connect flash loan fees to Treasury
3. Launch staking rewards program
4. Begin DAO governance operations
5. Community onboarding

## üìù Important Notes

**Admin Control:**
- You (0x7903c63CB9f42284d03BC2a124474760f9C1390b) have full control initially
- Can mint remaining tokens
- Can create vesting schedules
- Can pause/unpause

**Decentralization Path:**
- Keep admin control until system is proven
- Gradually transfer roles to Timelock
- Eventually, only DAO can make changes

**Safety:**
- 48-hour timelock prevents instant changes
- Community can react to malicious proposals
- Emergency pause always available

---

## üéØ Gas Estimate

**Total Deployment Cost:**
- Estimated: 13.5M gas
- At 50 gwei: ~0.675 MATIC (~$0.50)
- At 100 gwei: ~1.35 MATIC (~$1.00)

**Recommended:**
- Have 10-20 MATIC in deployer wallet
- Deploy during low gas times

## ‚úÖ Deployment Checklist

Before running deploy script:

- [ ] `.env` file has `PRIVATE_KEY` for admin wallet
- [ ] `.env` file has `POLYGON_RPC_URL`
- [ ] `.env` file has `POLYGONSCAN_API_KEY` (for verification)
- [ ] Deployer wallet has 10-20 MATIC
- [ ] Confirmed admin address: 0x7903c63CB9f42284d03BC2a124474760f9C1390b
- [ ] Compiled contracts successfully (`npx hardhat compile`)

After deployment:

- [ ] All 5 contracts verified on PolygonScan
- [ ] Admin balance = 100M C12DAO
- [ ] Treasury balance = 200M C12DAO
- [ ] Can delegate voting power
- [ ] Governor connected to Timelock
- [ ] Staking connected to Treasury

---

## üÜò Troubleshooting

**If deployment fails:**
1. Check gas price isn't too high
2. Verify RPC URL is working
3. Ensure wallet has enough MATIC
4. Check contract compilation is clean

**If verification fails:**
1. Wait 30 seconds after deployment
2. Use exact constructor args from deploy script
3. Try manual verification on PolygonScan UI

**If minting fails:**
1. Verify admin address is correct
2. Check you're using correct network
3. Ensure MAX_SUPPLY not exceeded
