## 🚧 Current Blocker: RPC Connection

**Issue:** The Polygon RPC endpoint is experiencing connection problems:
```
Error: could not detect network (event="noNetwork", code=NETWORK_ERROR)
```

**Cause:** Your current RPC provider is either:
- Rate-limited (free tier restrictions)
- Temporarily down
- Requires authentication
- Network connectivity issues

**Impact:** Cannot send transactions to Polygon mainnet

---

## 🔧 Solution: Fix RPC Connection

### Option 1: Use Alchemy (⭐ Recommended)

**Why Alchemy:**
- Most reliable for mainnet deployments

**Setup Steps:**
1. Go to https://www.alchemy.com/
2. Sign up for free account
3. Create new app:
   - Chain: Polygon
   - Network: Mainnet
4. Copy your API endpoint URL
5. Update `.env`:
   ```bash
   POLYGON_RPC=https://polygon-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/YOUR_API_KEY
   ```

### Option 2: Use Infura

**Setup Steps:**
1. Go to https://infura.io/
2. Sign up and create project
3. Select Polygon Mainnet
4. Copy endpoint
5. Update `.env`:
   ```bash
   POLYGON_RPC=https://polygon-mainnet.infura.io/v3/YOUR_PROJECT_ID
   ```

### Option 3: Use QuickNode

**Setup Steps:**
1. Go to https://www.quicknode.com/
2. Create Polygon mainnet endpoint
3. Update `.env` with provided URL

### Option 4: Public RPC (Backup)

**For quick testing only** (not recommended for production):
```bash
POLYGON_RPC=https://polygon-rpc.com
# or
POLYGON_RPC=https://rpc.ankr.com/polygon
```

### Step 3: Verify Contracts on PolygonScan

The deployment script will provide verification commands:

```bash
# Verify C12DAO Token
npx hardhat verify --network polygon <C12DAO_ADDRESS> 0x7903c63CB9f42284d03BC2a124474760f9C1390b

# Verify Timelock
npx hardhat verify --network polygon <TIMELOCK_ADDRESS> "172800" "[]" "[0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000]" 0x7903c63CB9f42284d03BC2a124474760f9C1390b

# Verify Governor
npx hardhat verify --network polygon <GOVERNOR_ADDRESS> <C12DAO_ADDRESS> <TIMELOCK_ADDRESS>

# Verify Treasury
npx hardhat verify --network polygon <TREASURY_ADDRESS> <C12DAO_ADDRESS> 0xD85F049E881D899Bd1a3600A58A08c2eA4f34811 0x7903c63CB9f42284d03BC2a124474760f9C1390b

# Verify Staking
npx hardhat verify --network polygon <STAKING_ADDRESS> <C12DAO_ADDRESS> <TREASURY_ADDRESS> 0x7903c63CB9f42284d03BC2a124474760f9C1390b
```

### Step 4: Test Deployed Contracts

```javascript
// Connect to deployed C12DAO token
const c12dao = await ethers.getContractAt("C12DAO", "<C12DAO_ADDRESS>");

// Check admin balance
const balance = await c12dao.balanceOf("0x7903c63CB9f42284d03BC2a124474760f9C1390b");
console.log("Admin balance:", ethers.utils.formatEther(balance), "C12DAO");

// Delegate voting power to self
await c12dao.delegate("0x7903c63CB9f42284d03BC2a124474760f9C1390b");

// Check voting power
const votes = await c12dao.getVotes("0x7903c63CB9f42284d03BC2a124474760f9C1390b");
console.log("Voting power:", ethers.utils.formatEther(votes), "votes");
```

## 🎓 Governance Guide

### How to Create a Proposal

1. **Acquire 100,000 C12DAO tokens** (proposal threshold)
2. **Delegate voting power to yourself**
3. **Create proposal** using Governor contract:
   ```javascript
   await governor.propose(
     [targetAddress],           // Target contract
     [0],                       // ETH value (0)
     [calldata],                // Function to call
     "Description of proposal"  // Proposal description
   );
   ```
4. **Wait 1 day** for voting to start
5. **Community votes** for 7 days
6. **If passed and quorum met**, wait 48 hours (timelock)
7. **Anyone can execute** the proposal

### How to Vote

1. **Delegate voting power** (if not already done)
2. **Wait for proposal voting period** to start
3. **Vote:**
   - 0 = Against
   - 1 = For
   - 2 = Abstain
4. **Voting power** = C12DAO balance at proposal creation

### How to Stake

1. **Approve C12DAO tokens** to staking contract
2. **Choose tier** (0-4):
   - 0 = Flexible (no lock)
   - 1 = Bronze (30 days)
   - 2 = Silver (90 days)
   - 3 = Gold (180 days)
   - 4 = Platinum (365 days)
3. **Stake tokens**
4. **Earn rewards** automatically
5. **Claim rewards** anytime
6. **Unstake** after lock period expires
