# üöÄ C12USD Live Deployment Plan
## Updated: December 24, 2024

---

## üéØ **DEPLOYMENT STRATEGY**

### **Phase 1: Pre-Deployment Validation** ‚è≥
- [ ] **Update .env with live production keys and endpoints**
- [ ] **Verify deployment setup with `npm run verify-setup`**
- [ ] **Fund wallet with 0.1 BNB and 1 POL**

### **Phase 2: Smart Contract Deployment** ‚è≥
- [ ] **Deploy Smart Contracts to BSC mainnet**
- [ ] **Deploy Smart Contracts to Polygon mainnet**
- [ ] **Verify contracts on BSCScan and PolygonScan**
- [ ] **Update .env with deployed contract addresses**

### **Phase 3: System Integration** ‚è≥
- [ ] **Configure live API keys and external service integrations**
- [ ] **Test backend API endpoints with deployed contracts**
- [ ] **Assess and test frontend build process**

### **Phase 4: Production Infrastructure** ‚è≥
- [ ] **Verify GCP production environment setup**
- [ ] **Setup production monitoring and logging**
- [ ] **Execute live production deployment to GCP**

### **Phase 5: Final Validation** ‚è≥
- [ ] **Conduct final security audit and contract verification**
- [ ] **Perform final deployment readiness checklist**

## üìã **DEPLOYMENT COMMANDS**

### **Pre-Deployment Verification**
```bash
# Verify setup is ready
npm run verify-setup

# Check balances and configuration
npm run compile
```

### **BSC Deployment**
```bash
# Deploy to BSC mainnet
npm run deploy:bsc

# Expected output:
# - C12USDToken contract address
# - MintRedeemGateway contract address
# - Role assignments confirmed
# - Gas costs: ~0.0375 BNB (~$38.21)
```

### **Polygon Deployment**
```bash
# Deploy to Polygon mainnet
npm run deploy:polygon

# Expected output:
# - C12USDToken contract address
# - MintRedeemGateway contract address
# - Role assignments confirmed
# - Gas costs: ~0.225 POL (~$0.10)
```

### **Contract Verification**
```bash
# Verify on BSCScan
npx hardhat verify --network bsc CONTRACT_ADDRESS [constructor_args]

# Verify on PolygonScan
npx hardhat verify --network polygon CONTRACT_ADDRESS [constructor_args]
```

---

## üîÑ **POST-DEPLOYMENT UPDATES**

### **Environment Variables Update**
After successful deployment, update `.env` with:
```bash
# BSC Contract Addresses
BSC_TOKEN_ADDRESS=DEPLOYED_TOKEN_ADDRESS
BSC_GATEWAY_ADDRESS=DEPLOYED_GATEWAY_ADDRESS

# Polygon Contract Addresses
POLYGON_TOKEN_ADDRESS=DEPLOYED_TOKEN_ADDRESS
POLYGON_GATEWAY_ADDRESS=DEPLOYED_GATEWAY_ADDRESS
```

### **LayerZero Peer Configuration**
```bash
# Set BSC ‚Üí Polygon peer
C12USDToken.setPeer(polygonEid, polygonTokenAddress)

# Set Polygon ‚Üí BSC peer
C12USDToken.setPeer(bscEid, bscTokenAddress)
```

## üîí **SECURITY CHECKPOINTS**

### **Pre-Deployment Security**
- [ ] Private key is for dedicated deployment wallet (not main wallet)
- [ ] All contracts compiled with optimization enabled
- [ ] Test suite passing with >95% success rate
- [ ] Access control roles properly configured
- [ ] Circuit breaker mechanisms tested

### **Post-Deployment Security**
- [ ] Contract ownership transferred to multisig (if applicable)
- [ ] Emergency pause functionality verified
- [ ] Circuit breaker can be triggered
- [ ] Cross-chain message verification working
- [ ] API endpoints secured and rate-limited

---

## üìä **MONITORING SETUP**

### **Contract Events to Monitor**
```solidity
// C12USDToken Events
event PilotMint(address indexed to, uint256 amount, bytes32 indexed receiptHash)
event PilotBurn(address indexed from, uint256 amount, bytes32 indexed receiptHash)
event CircuitBreakerTripped(address indexed triggeredBy, string reason)
event CircuitBreakerReset(address indexed resetBy)

// MintRedeemGateway Events
event MintExecuted(address indexed to, uint256 amount, string nonce)
event RedeemExecuted(address indexed from, uint256 amount, string nonce)
```

### **Database Monitoring**
- Reserve snapshot updates
- Mint/redeem operations
- Audit log entries
- System configuration changes

---

## üéØ **SUCCESS CRITERIA**

### **Deployment Success**
- [ ] Both contracts deployed successfully
- [ ] Contract verification completed
- [ ] Cross-chain functionality tested
- [ ] Admin roles configured correctly
- [ ] Circuit breakers functional

### **Integration Success**
- [ ] Backend API connecting to contracts
- [ ] Database recording operations

## ‚ö° **EMERGENCY PROCEDURES**

### **Circuit Breaker Activation**
```bash
# If issues detected, immediately trip circuit breaker
C12USDToken.tripCircuitBreaker("REASON_FOR_ACTIVATION")
```

### **Contract Pausing**
```bash
# Emergency pause all operations
C12USDToken.pause()
MintRedeemGateway.pause()
```

### **Rollback Preparation**
- Keep deployment transaction hashes
- Document all configuration changes
- Maintain backup of previous state
- Have emergency contact procedures ready
