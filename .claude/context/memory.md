# C12USD Project Memory - Context Engineering

This file maintains compressed context summaries for the C12USD cross-chain stablecoin project, enabling efficient context loading across iterations.

## Context Engineering Format
Each iteration follows: **Task → Changes → Decisions → Tests → Status**

**Format Guidelines:**
- Use bullet points for scanning efficiency
- Include task completion status and acceptance criteria results
- Reference documentation locations rather than duplicating content
- Maintain chronological order with newest entries at bottom
- Compress technical details: focus on "why" over "how"

## Iteration 1: Environment Setup (Task 010_env_setup.md) - 2025-09-24

**Changes made:**
* Initialized Node.js project with pnpm package manager
* Set up Hardhat v2.26.3 for blockchain development with CommonJS modules
* Installed core dependencies: OpenZeppelin contracts, LayerZero OFT v3.2.1, Chainlink contracts, ethers v5.8.0
* Created hardhat.config.js with BSC and Polygon network configurations
* Set up TypeScript and ESLint configurations
* Created project structure: contracts/, scripts/, test/, docs/
* Generated setup documentation in docs/setup.md and bootstrap report in docs/BOOTSTRAP_REPORT.md

**Key decisions:**
* Used Hardhat v2 instead of v3 for better compatibility with existing plugins
* Chose ethers v5 over v6 for compatibility with LayerZero and other ecosystem tools
* Used CommonJS modules instead of ES modules due to Hardhat v2 limitations
* Excluded generated typechain files from linting and type checking to avoid noise

**Tests run:**
* Successful contract compilation with Solidity 0.8.24
* TypeScript type checking passes without errors
* Created and ran simple test contract to verify complete setup
* All environment setup acceptance criteria met

**Outstanding issues:**
* Need to populate .env file with actual values for deployment
* Ready to proceed to next task: 020_database_setup.md
* All development tooling is functional and ready for C12USD implementation

## Iteration 2: Database Setup (Task 020_database_setup.md) - 2025-09-24

**Changes made:**
* Installed Prisma ORM with PostgreSQL as database provider
* Created comprehensive database schema for C12USD stablecoin operations
* Defined 6 core models: User, MintReceipt, RedeemReceipt, ReserveSnapshot, AuditLog, SystemConfig
* Created security rules documentation with default-deny policy and role-based access
* Defined database indexes for optimal query performance
* Added deployment documentation with local/production setup instructions
* Created database helper functions and client configuration
* Added database scripts to package.json (generate, migrate, deploy, studio, reset, seed)
* Created seed file with initial system configuration

**Key decisions:**
* Chose PostgreSQL over NoSQL for ACID compliance and financial data integrity
* Used Prisma ORM for type-safe database operations and migrations
* Implemented comprehensive audit logging for all operations
* Designed schema to support both BSC and Polygon chains
* Used decimal types for all financial amounts to prevent floating-point errors
* Applied security-first design with explicit role-based access control

**Tests run:**
* Prisma schema validation passed successfully
* Generated Prisma client without errors
* Database configuration tests passed
* All acceptance criteria met for database setup task

**Outstanding issues:**
* Database not yet connected (requires actual PostgreSQL instance)
* Need to run initial migration when DATABASE_URL is configured
* Ready to proceed to next task: 030_contract_scaffold.md
* Database layer is fully designed and ready for deployment

## Iteration 3: Contract Scaffolding (Task 030_contract_scaffold.md) - 2025-09-24

**Changes made:**
* Resolved OpenZeppelin version compatibility issues by downgrading to v4.9.6 (LayerZero requirement)
* Created C12USDToken.sol - LayerZero OFT-based cross-chain stablecoin contract
* Created MintRedeemGateway.sol - Signature-based gateway for secure mint/redeem operations
* Updated deployment script (deploy.js) with network-specific LayerZero endpoint configuration
* Fixed import paths and function signatures for OpenZeppelin v4 compatibility
* Created comprehensive contract documentation in contracts/README.md
* Added proper TypeScript configuration and ESLint rules for contracts
* Successfully compiled all contracts with full type generation

**Key decisions:**
* Used LayerZero OFT (Omnichain Fungible Token) for native cross-chain functionality
* Implemented gateway pattern separating authorization (gateway) from token logic (OFT)
* Applied role-based access control with separate MINTER, BURNER, PAUSER, and CIRCUIT_BREAKER roles
* Used OpenZeppelin v4.9.6 instead of v5 due to LayerZero compatibility requirements
* Implemented signature-based mint/redeem with nonce protection for replay attack prevention
* Added circuit breaker functionality for emergency stops and security incidents

**Tests run:**
* Contract compilation successful with 48 Solidity files compiled
* TypeScript type generation completed (136 typings generated)
* All inheritance and dependency issues resolved
* Gateway contract compiles with proper ECDSA signature verification

**Outstanding issues:**
* Local deployment requires mock LayerZero endpoint for testing
* Need actual LayerZero endpoint addresses for testnet/mainnet deployment
* Ready to proceed to next task: 040_tests_and_ci.md
* Smart contract layer is fully implemented and ready for testing

## Iteration 4: Observability Implementation (Task 070_observability.md) - 2025-09-24

**Changes made:**
* Enhanced Winston logging with structured JSON format and correlation ID support
* Created comprehensive metrics collection system with in-memory storage and Prometheus format support
* Implemented correlation ID middleware for distributed request tracing across all services
* Added enhanced health endpoints (/health, /ready, /metrics, /metrics/prometheus) with dependency checks
* Created alerting configuration with critical/warning thresholds for error rates, latency, memory, security events
* Built monitoring dashboard configuration for Google Cloud with business and technical metrics
* Updated server middleware stack with request logging, error handling, and metrics collection
* Created comprehensive observability documentation with operational procedures

**Key decisions:**
* Used Winston for structured logging instead of basic console.log for better searchability and context
* Implemented custom metrics collector to avoid OpenTelemetry/npm installation issues during development
* Added correlation IDs to every request for full distributed tracing capabilities
* Created both JSON and Prometheus metrics endpoints for monitoring system flexibility
* Designed alerting with proper severity levels (critical, warning) and escalation paths
* Applied observability best practices with actionable alerts and meaningful KPIs

**Tests run:**
* Verified all observability module structures and dependencies
* Tested logging utility functions and correlation ID generation
* Validated metrics collection and export functionality
* Confirmed health endpoint response formats and dependency checks
* All observability components successfully integrated into server middleware

**Outstanding issues:**
* Metrics system ready for production deployment with cloud monitoring integration
* Alerting policies configured for Google Cloud Monitoring (needs deployment to activate)
* Dashboard ready for import into monitoring systems
* Ready to proceed to next task in workflow sequence
* Full observability stack implemented with comprehensive documentation and operational procedures

## Iteration 5: Localization Implementation (Task 100_localisation.md) - 2025-09-24

**Changes made:**
* Implemented comprehensive i18next configuration with react-i18next integration

* Built custom LanguageSwitcher component with three variants (dropdown, button, minimal)
* Created I18nProvider wrapper with automatic language detection and browser preference handling
* Updated Layout and Dashboard components to use translation hooks and keys
* Developed utility functions for number, currency, and date formatting with locale support
* Created comprehensive test suite covering language detection, formatting, and translation content
* Built complete localization documentation with implementation guides and best practices

**Key decisions:**
* Used react-i18next with browser language detection for seamless user experience

* Implemented persistent language preferences using localStorage with fallback detection
* Created responsive language switcher suitable for both desktop and mobile interfaces
* Applied locale-aware formatting for numbers, currencies, and dates
* Used interpolation for dynamic content like network names and user data
