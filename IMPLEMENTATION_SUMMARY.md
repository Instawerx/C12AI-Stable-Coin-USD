### 3. **TOKEN_PRICING.md** (Official Pricing)
Official pricing structure and formulas:

**C12USD (Stablecoin):**
- Price: $1.00 USD (fixed, never changes)
- Ratio: 1:1 backed
- Minimum: $10.00

**C12DAO (Governance):**
- Price: $3.30 USD per token
- Icon: 💧 (Blue-Pink Gradient Droplet)
- Minimum: $3.30 (1 token)
- Supply: 1B total (400M available for public)

**Calculation Examples:**
```typescript
// $100 USD → C12USD
100 / 1.00 = 100.00 C12USD

// $100 USD → C12DAO
100 / 3.30 = 30.30 C12DAO

// 10 C12DAO → USD
10 * 3.30 = $33.00 USD
```
